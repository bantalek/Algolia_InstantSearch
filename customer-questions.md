Question 1:
Hello,

I'm new to search engines, and there are a lot of concepts I'm not educated on. To make my onboarding smoother, it'd help if you could provide me with some definitions of the following concepts:
- Records
- Indexing

I'm also struggling with understanding what types of metrics would be useful to include in the "Custom Ranking."



Cheers,
George


George, 

Lets work together to make things a little more clear. A record, is an individual schemaless item which we can store and search for you in our system. A record can have an unlimited number of attributes up to 10 kilobytes in size. This item has characteristics just like a dog, a cat, or a football. So we store characteristic information that you provide about each individual record in our system. We can group these records in our system as an index such as Dog's in San Francisco - a collection of records with a distinct commonality that is beneficial to you or your clients. Being able to group many records information together based on characteristics can be very useful in providing services, reflecting on the past, and understanding your current market environment. Do you have any questions about this? 

Metrics in custom ranking can be be very subjective depending on the circumstances. Your target audience is going the be the most important factor in this decision. Some things to keep in mind when choosing a ranking is that people are typically looking for results that are personal, that offer a sense of trust or intamacy/understanding, perhaps a sense of proximity and convenience. Queries to your content should demonstrate the value you bring to the customer, So we need to explore your brand in order to best understand how your content should be organized. 



Question 2:
Hello,

Sorry to give you the kind of feedback that I know you do not want to hear, but I really hate the new dashboard design. Clearing and deleting indexes are now several clicks away. I am needing to use these features while iterating, so this is inconvenient.

Matt,

Matt, 

I am so sorry to hear about your inconvenience. Lets work together to get your workflow back to a a level of satisfaction. I will make a note about this new website layout immediately and run some further testing to see what can be done to improve user experience. In the meanwhile, have you had the chance to take a look at our REST API? Its a really convenient way to automate your CRUD operations on your index. With a few lines of code you could be clearing, updating, and deleting just by running a file. We currently support 11 languages and 4 mobile SDKs including javascript, python, php, ruby and django.

If you are interested, take a look at the API below and let me know if you have any questions. I understand your time is valuable and I am happy to help optimize this process however we can.

Question 3:
Hi,

I'm looking to integrate Algolia in my website. Will this be a lot of development work for me? What's the high level process look like?

Regards,
Leo



One of the great things about this service is that its so easy to get up and running. We have completed alot of the hard work ahead of time so that integration is simple and fast. Getting started integrating a powerful search into your website can be as simple as uploading your product information to a database and making room for two new components on one of your webpages - a searchbar, and a results window. Now, depending on your initiative we can fine tune the user experience and provide rich site functionality such as geolocation, custom ranking, search filtration and ordering, and much more over time if we work together. 


Process: 

Head over to the Algolia Dashboard and upload your product datafiles to make a searchable index.

Check out our ranking tab under indexes to configure the search attributes you think will be most useful to customers. Next you will want to set some attributes for faceting - facets are attributes that your records can be filtered by such as Customer Rating or Price. You will notice more advanced options in the ranking section such as interpretation & typography which can be fine tuned later for an optimal user experience.

While you are on the dashboard go ahead and get your Application ID and Search-Only API Key which we will use to create your Algolia client

Once you have completed the above steps, getting an Algolia search client running on your browser is easy and powerful. You can learn how to integrate a new search component in a few lines of code through the Algolia documentation (link below). Here you can look at some of our popular Search libraries such as InstantSearch.
